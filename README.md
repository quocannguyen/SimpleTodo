# Pre-work - *Simple Todo*

**Simple Todo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Quoc An Nguyen**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [x] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Notify the user if the item is successfully added or edited.

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces is similar to Windows Forms application in the sense that the buttons and text fields can be generated by dragging onto the app. Android Studio's constraints appear to be useful in adapting to various screen sizes. Something like <div></div> in HTML where the buttons and text fields can be grouped together can be helpful.

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** An ArrayAdapter connects the data from a source like ArrayList and displays to the layouts in the .xml file. getView returns a View for ArrayAdapter, which can be expensive memory-wise. Instead, the ArrayAdapter can use the view that the user has scrolled passed as the convertView to convert it into a new View.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
